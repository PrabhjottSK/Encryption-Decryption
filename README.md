# Encryption-Decryption-Tool

### One of the oldest methods of encryption is called the Caesar Cipher. Julius Caesar employed this technique to communicate with his allies, concealing the message from others. Caesar Ciper encrypts the text by taking a fixed numerical input value and shifting it down the alphabet. 

### The Vigenere Cipher is another method of encrypting alphabetic text using polyalphabetic substitution. Vigenere's Cipher used various different Caesar Ciphers based on the letters of a keyword.

### These ciphers are considered cryptography as they encourage the practice and study of techniques for secure communication.
